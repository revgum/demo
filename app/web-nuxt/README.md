# Nuxt POC App

# TODO
- Add documentation details for install/setup?

# Add note about having to delete the demo_web-nuxt* volume if installing new node modules

# Add note about `npm run localhost` and mocking out Dapr responses, this allows for a developer to work on the front-end in isolation without the backend existing yet.
